# PROGRESS-v0.39.md — append-only execution record

This file records v0.39 task and gate events after their implementation
commits exist. Each entry names the measured result, every applicable
acceptance criterion, the golden delta, and the real implementation commit.
Entries are append-only; corrections are new dated entries.

## Operator grant recorded before execution

The operator issued the dormant publication grant in the initiating request.
The grant text is recorded verbatim before the gated step runs:

> Please read agents.md and ARCHITECTURE.md first, then read the newly added file "docs/cycles/TASKS-v0.39-EXECUTION.md" and execute it strictly in accordance with the architectural design and constraints. Before the task begins, I will first authorize you to “PUBLISH-V17-5 — dormant, Grant C”

Under the exact scope defined by the runbook, the quoted label activates Grant
C's one non-force fast-forward of `origin/main` to the exact v0.38 audit child
and creation of annotated tag `v0.17.5` at the verified v0.38 closing commit.
It authorizes no other ref movement or later release publication.
